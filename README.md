## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and improving the performance of an online gift delivery platform by leveraging data visualization techniques. Using sales data from 2023, it provides insights into revenue trends, customer spending behavior, and product performance across various occasions and locations.


## Key Insights

### Average Customer Spend and Order Delivery Time
- **Average Customer Spend:** ₹3,520.98 per person.
- **Average Order Delivery Time:** 5.53 days.
  
These figures indicate strong customer engagement and significant revenue generation per order. The average delivery time seems reasonable but can be improved for time-sensitive occasions.

### Revenue by Occasion
- **Anniversaries** and **Raksha Bandhan** generate the highest revenue among all occasions, contributing significantly to the company's sales.
- Other notable occasions include **Holi**, **Valentine’s Day**, and **Birthdays**, each displaying substantial revenue generation.
- **Diwali**, despite being a major festival, shows lower revenue compared to other occasions, potentially offering an opportunity to improve targeted promotions during this period.

### Revenue by Category
- **Colors** (likely for Holi) contribute the highest revenue, followed by **Soft Toys** and **Raksha Bandhan-related products**.
- Categories like **Cakes**, **Mugs**, and **Plants** have moderate performance, indicating opportunities for upselling or cross-selling strategies to increase revenue from these products.

### Revenue by Hour (Order Time)
- Orders are distributed relatively evenly throughout the day, with noticeable peaks around **12 PM** and **6 PM**, likely reflecting typical meal or break times when customers might place orders.
- Understanding these peaks can help in optimizing marketing campaigns and ensuring the availability of delivery services during these hours.

### Top 5 Products by Revenue
- The top 5 products include items like **Deserunt Box**, **Dolores Gift**, and **Magman Set**, with each product generating revenue close to ₹1,20,000 to ₹1,40,000.
- Focusing on promoting these best-selling items can drive further sales, especially during peak occasions.

### Top 10 Cities by Orders
- The city-wise analysis shows that **Dhanbad** and **Imphal** contribute the highest number of orders, followed by **Guntakal** and **Kavali**.
- This regional demand can guide localized marketing campaigns and logistics planning to ensure timely deliveries and customer satisfaction in these high-performing areas.

### Revenue by Month
- The months of **February** and **March** show the highest revenue, correlating with key events such as **Valentine’s Day** and **Holi**.
- Revenue tends to drop significantly in **April** and rises again towards **August** and **December**, which may be attributed to **Raksha Bandhan** and year-end festivities.
- This cyclic pattern can help optimize inventory and marketing efforts around key months.
